Getting the basic project setup.  Don't know the current theme.  I want to build something with a lot of UI.

I'm planning to use a UI library I've been working on, we'll see how that goes.

Also planning to use CSS for rendering.  CSS vars for movements, background image for sprite sheets.  I may switch to canvas though.

First step is to just get a basic project going.

Got a basic export process going for aseprite.  Looks like an amazing tool actually. You can export metadata/sclices/specific layers.

My process I think will be to use that tool as much as possible and make the game code just trust whatever metadata is there.  This is the opposite to what I normally do.

I've just been watching some tutorials for the sprite app.  And thinking of ideas while havig a coffee or two.  The theme is "keep it alive".  I initially thought of a game where you're protecting an egg from dinosaurs and while you carry the egg you can't attack.

But that's a lot of work.  And I'm not sure the core loop is that fun without a lot of environment to create interest.  It also probably needs some amazing sprite work and animations and I really want to work with UI this time.

I was going to build it all the same, but I just had an idea where you defend a convoy in space.  I've always wanted to make a space game in Ludum Dare, but what pushed me over the edge was seeing the polygon tool in the sprite app, I thought, that could make for some really quick ship design.

Also a space game would probably have a lot of UI, e.g. upgrading weapons/hulls, choosing missions, spending money, potentially a minimap.  There's a lot of UI challenge for sure.

I might change my mind soon, who knows.  I really just want to get a basic workflow with this sprite app going so I can mess around with art assets instead of code when I'm really tired tomorrow.
